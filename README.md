Adventures in AI by The Pathan along with his friends around the world

Goals:
1. Learn to develop AI by developing a sample app
2. Use open source apps for development
3. Long term - Start an AI business

My plan:
Develop a program to process the huge amount of scanned data at my office since 1980s using AI

Hoping some of you will stick around with me on this journey, teach me a few things and we all learn together along the way.
